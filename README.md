# Introducing a Javanese Pre-Trained Language Model Based on Wav2vec for Speech Transcription

Welcome to the Javanese Pre-Trained Language Model based on Wav2vec, available on Hugging Face! [Link](https://huggingface.co/indonesian-nlp/wav2vec2-indonesian-javanese-sundanese)

This language model is specifically designed for transcription of Javanese speech using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The model is based on the Wav2vec model, which has proven to be an effective approach for speech recognition and natural language processing.

After testing the Javanese Pre-Trained Language Model based on Wav2vec using .wav audio files, I have found that the model is capable of transcribing Javanese speech with a reasonable level of accuracy. The model has shown promising results and I believe it will be a valuable tool for natural language processing tasks involving Javanese language. I hope that this pre-trained model will prove useful to researchers, language teachers, and anyone interested in exploring the Javanese language through machine learning.

This Javanese Pre-Trained Language Model is available on Hugging Face, which provides access to a wide range of powerful and high-performing pre-trained models for natural language processing. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your workflow, making it a valuable tool for researchers, language teachers, and anyone interested in the Javanese language.
